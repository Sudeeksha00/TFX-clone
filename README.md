<h4>Model Centric</h4>
In the model centric approach Data Scientist will stive to make the data fit their model through feature enginearing. First they will start with the base model. If their existing model fails they will develop new one that adequately address the problem. 
This type of Data Scientist approach is always be like keeping the data fixed after standard preprocessing and iteratively imporves the model to deal with the noise in the data.

<h4>Data Centric</h4>
In the data centric approach Data Scientist will expose the data with the right analysis technique. They Highly inverst their time in ensuring the data quaity. Data Consistenct is a key here. They build complex visualizations to understand the data.
This type of Data Scientist approach is always be like holding the code/algorithms fixed and interated the data quality.

In  my perspective, to achieve a good AI solution there must be balance between model and the data quality. I too more conscious on data side.  Andrew NG and his team prove the data quality is a key by show it with a experiment with real-world data.

The common practice amongst researchers is to hold the data fixed while trying to improve the code. But, when the dataset size is modest (<10,000 examples), Andrew Ng suggests ML teams will make faster progress, given the dataset is good.<br>

Andrew Ng mentioned how everyone jokes about ML is 80% data preparation, but no one seems to care. A quick look at the arxiv would give an idea of the direction ML research is going. There is unprecedented competition around beating the benchmarks. If Google has BERT then OpenAI has GPT-3. But, these fancy models take up only 20% of a business problem.
